    content_key: Field containing the chunk content to gather
    doc_id_key: Field linking all chunks from the same original document
    order_key: Field specifying the order/sequence of each chunk within the document

    peripheral_chunks: Configuration for including context from surrounding (previous and/or next) chunks. This helps each chunk retain important context that may be necessary for accurate downstream processing.
    - You can specify previous and/or next context, and control how much content to include before and after each chunk.
    - For each (previous/next), you can define:
        - head: The first chunk(s) in the section (e.g., the chunk immediately before/after the current one)
        - middle: Chunks between head and tail (e.g., summarized versions of further-away chunks)
        - tail: The last chunk(s) in the section (e.g., furthest before/after the current chunk you want to include)
        - For each section, specify:
            - count: Number of chunks to include (head and tail only)
            - content_key: Which field to use for context (e.g., full text or summary)

    Example:
        peripheral_chunks:
        previous:
            head:
            count: 1
            content_key: full_content
            middle:
            content_key: summary_content
            tail:
            count: 2
            content_key: full_content
        next:
            head:
            count: 1
            content_key: full_content

    - This config means:
        • Include the full content of 1 chunk before, summaries of all in-between previous chunks, and the full content of the 2 furthest-back previous chunks.
        • Include the full content of the 1 chunk immediately after the current chunk.
    - Use full content for immediate context (head/tail) and summaries for middle sections to balance completeness and token efficiency.
    - Only include next chunks if future context is important; by default, focus on previous for most text documents.
    """,
    optional_parameters="""
    doc_header_key: (optional) Field containing extracted headers for each chunk.
    - This field provides the hierarchical structure of document sections, enabling the Gather operation to reconstruct header context for each chunk.
    - To use this, you must first run a map operation that extracts headers from each chunk, using the following schema:
        headers: list of {header: string, level: integer}
    - Example map operation:

        name: extract_headers
        type: map
        input:
            - agreement_text_chunk
        prompt: Extract any section headers from the following merger agreement chunk:
        {{ input.agreement_text_chunk }}
        Return the headers as a list, preserving their hierarchy.
        output.schema:
            headers: list[{header: string, level: integer}]
    """,
    returns="""
    The Gather operation produces one output item for each input chunk. Each output includes:

    - All original key-value pairs from the input document
    - {content_key}_rendered: The content of the chunk, enriched with:
        • Reconstructed header hierarchy (if doc_header_key is provided)
        • Previous context (chunks before the current chunk, if configured)
        • The main chunk, clearly marked
        • Next context (chunks after the current chunk, if configured)
        • Indications of skipped content between included sections (e.g., "[... 500 characters skipped ...]")

    For example, if your content_key is agreement_text_chunk, the Gather operation adds:
        agreement_text_chunk_rendered

    Note: No additional unique identifier or chunk number fields are created by Gather. (Those are typically added by Split.) Gather focuses on adding the rendered, context-enriched content field.
